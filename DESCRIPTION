Title: Ternary Network Estimation
Description: Gene-regulatory network (GRN) modeling seeks to infer 
        dependencies between genes and thereby provide insight into 
        the regulatory relationships that exist within a cell. 
        This package provides a computational Bayesian approach to
        GRN estimation from perturbation experiments using a ternary 
        network model, in which gene expression is discretized into 
        one of 3 states: up, unchanged, or down). The ternarynet package
        includes a parallel implementation of the replica exchange Monte 
        Carlo algorithm for fitting network models, using MPI.
